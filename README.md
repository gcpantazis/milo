*v0.0.1*

Routes, models, schemas, relationships, layouts.

Todo:
-----

* Extensibility. How would I make a Sass pipeline, etc.?
* Remapping sources for localization, etc.
* Related to mapping, remote data sources.
* Static-izer - Generate a static site. Require that your routes map directly to model IDs for
  "automatic" generation. Else provide an array of URLs you'd like the sytem to parse and output.
